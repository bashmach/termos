## Description

[![Koding Hackathon](/docs/images/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)

Project's name is "Termos" (it's a quibble for a phrase "terms of service" and word "thermos"). The main idea is to build a platform which will help users to understand legal documents of their favorite websites and learn about their pitfalls. 

It's divided on 2 parts - Chrome Extension and Website. With Chrome Extension user able to discover the status of current website by Termos-indicator or send a own comment on, for example, "Terms and Conditions" page on this webpage.

From the Termos website user can download the Termos Chrome extension or scan any domain directly from the main page and read reviews of other users (review reporters). I have had plans was to implement a donation system with whereby users can show one's gratitude for the reviewers, but there are only 24 hours in a day :)
